  <h1 align="center">About Us</h1><p>Iâ€™m reliable and professional. I have been a DJ for over 9 years and never tire of the Saturday night routine. After 7 years of working for Maximum Music DJ Services I decided to venture out on my own and start a new business. Every reception  deserves a DJ who has the experience and the professionalism to handle the multiple demands of such an occasion. I Got The Beat DJ Services provides just that. I Got The Beat has a full and up-to-date CD library covering all your music needs. Everyone of my receptions is approached with the goal of having fun and keeping people dancing. I blend into the background but can also be outgoing depending on the needs of the client. I enjoy listening  and playing all types of music and balancing the requests of young and old alike. At the end of dinner I start playing some recognizable tunes, which gets people tapping there toes and ready to party!! </p>
